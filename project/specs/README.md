| Name                 | Description                                         |
|:---------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| `paralleldots.json`	| The swagger that described external service |
| `product-service.json` | The swagger that described API Builder product service |
| `review-service.json` | The swagger that described API Builder review service |
| `product-review-service.json` | The swagger that described API Builder product-review service. |

The first three specifications are used in the Demo with [API Builder swagger plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axway/api-builder-plugin-fn-swagger) to create flow-nodes for  communication with those services.
